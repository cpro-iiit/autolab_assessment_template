<h2>Merge Strings</h2>

In this lab, you will write a C program, called <kbd>hello.c</kbd> 

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<p>
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr" <br>
Output: "apbqcr" <br>

Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:<br>
word1:  a   b   c <br>
word2:    p   q   r <br>
merged: a p b q c r <br>
</p>    

<h3>Example 2:</h3>
<p>
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs" <br>
Output: "apbqrs" <br>
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end. <br>
word1:  a   b <br>
word2:    p   q   r   s <br>
merged: a p b q   r   s <br>
</p>
<h3>Example 3:</h3>
<p>
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq" <br>
Output: "apbqcd" <br>
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end. <br>
word1:  a   b   c   d <br>
word2:    p   q  <br>
merged: a p b q c   d <br>
</p>   

<h3> Constraints: </h3>
<p>
        a. 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
</p>
<p>
        b. word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
